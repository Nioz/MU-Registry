# MU-Registry
A full stack project that allows users to create different types of accounts, each with a different level or permissions.

Students may add, register, and deregister from classes and view their upcoming semester.
Admins may post, edit, and remove classes that students may sign up for. They may also reset, delete, or block student accounts.
